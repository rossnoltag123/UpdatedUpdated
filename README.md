# Logic

I have the levelModel fully tested and working and a few other tests. I spent a little bit of time trying to get
the text display working in a seperate test scene and also used an editor window, for somthing different. The original
idea was to display the whole game in the console. Any way ive been up to my eyes with a few projects, sorry for the
late update. I will be able to get some more testing done during the week.
